            Hi, my name is Angel and I am 20 years of age. I was stuck for the longest and didn't know where I was heading in life. I've had all these ideas but none of them seemed to click with me. Until I found software enginnering. I found this field of study through a friend of mine and I have never been more dedicated to something. I found out about flatiron school through the same friend which already graduated and is finding success in the world. I am looking forward to working with everybody this year and growing together to be the best we can be.
